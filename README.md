Agenda Builder And Role Analyzer Application for Public Speaking Practice Meetings

Our club, Timber Talkers does, monthly calendaring for roles. Users are not required to sign in and jocky for spots on the schedule.  The VP Education plans the role distribution and distributes roles according to who has not had the role in a while. While it is easy to see who has done a role by our GoogleDocs spreadsheet manually entered, it does not display, or one cannot easily tell who has NOT had a role in a while. 

This application is being created to allow algorithms to count the languishing of role weight so that the longer someone goes without a role the heavier they are in getting to be placed in that role. It should in theory give all members of the club practice with every role.  

Allowances are made for more experienced members to have harder roles (Toastmaster, Evaluators, General Evaluator, Speakers). 

The calendar has options for those members that will be unavailable on a particular club meeting date. (no roles assigned.)

There is an option for users to allow weight to carry, that is not be assigned a speaking role if they wish a break.

Beginners can be selected to have only minor roles unil they have given 6 speeches. (Timer, Uncounter, Squawker).

Medium duty roles are TableTopics Master, Grammarian, Humor Master, One Minute Toastmaster, One Minute Leader.

Readability of the application can be modified in export to .csv with x and y switching to be able to paste into our current platform of GoogleDocs which happens to be names on the left, dates across the top and roles supplied in the grid.
